# Goal of Mattrax

The goal of Mattrax is to make a simple to use, yet advanced Mobile Device Management server that allows a single policy to be enforced across all of your organisation's devices no matter the operating system.

## Development Progress

Mattrax has a functional dashboard and MDM component although security is lacking and policies can't yet be scoped to a device or deployed via MDM.
